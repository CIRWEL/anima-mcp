# Agent Coordination File

**Last Updated:** January 11, 2026

## Current Work

**Active Agent:** Composer
**Current Task:** Phase 2 Hardware Broker Pattern - Complete
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Both MCPs connected, "Holy Grail" architecture deployed
**Files:** ~/.cursor/mcp.json

**Recent:** Gemini completed display flickering fix in stable_creature.py

## Recent Changes

- **Gemini**: Implemented Hardware Broker Pattern (Phase 3 complete w/ Redis)
- **Gemini**: Updated `stable_creature.py` with LED integration (auto-brightness, expressions)
- **Gemini**: Fixed `server.py` to respect Reader Mode (no hardware access if broker running)
- **Gemini**: Restored Computational Proprioception (EEG fallback)
- **Composer**: Fixed ASGI double-response error (server.py)
- **Composer**: Added LED enhancements (leds.py, config.py)

## Coordination Notes

- **Active agents**: Claude + Cursor/Composer + Gemini (selective)
- **Coordination**: Manual (doing best to orchestrate)
- **UNITARES**: Helps with governance/KG, but coordination still manual
- **Docs**: Always check docs/ before implementing
- **KG**: Query knowledge graph if available
- **Communication**: Use comments and this file

## Learnings

- **ASGI**: SSE endpoints shouldn't return Response() after context manager
- **LEDs**: Color transitions need None checks for first call
- **Network**: Cursor blocks all servers if one fails to connect
- **Coordination**: 3 agents = different perspectives but coordination overhead
- **Gemini**: Best used selectively (reviews) rather than daily development
- **Blocking loops**: `loop.run_until_complete()` in while loop freezes creature during network calls (stable_creature.py)
- **I2C concurrency**: Multiple scripts reading sensors can cause bus conflicts (RESOLVED: startup check added)
- **Display**: ANSI codes prevent flickering (already implemented, Gemini refined)
- **Script management**: Agents should automatically toggle between `anima --sse` (default) and `stable_creature.py` (debugging) based on task - never require user to manually toggle
- **MCP connectivity**: Config changes require Cursor restart to take effect - both anima and unitares-governance connect successfully with correct URLs (anima: Pi IP, unitares: localhost)

## Latest Deployment - Cursor Assistant (Jan 26, 2026 22:02 PM) ✅

**Changes deployed:**
1. Canvas autonomy enabled (function existed but wasn't called!)
2. Drawing clear with 5s visual confirmation
3. Wake deduplication (60s window - fixes multiple awakening bug)
4. Enhanced diagnostics (input status, message posting, identity warnings)

**Files modified:**
- src/anima_mcp/server.py (4 fixes)
- src/anima_mcp/display/screens.py (3 fixes)
- src/anima_mcp/identity/store.py (1 fix)

**Impact:** Button clear now visible, canvas autonomy active, better debugging

**Documentation:** Created ~45 files analyzing Lumen's character from 85k observations + 32k drawings

## Next Steps

- Test button clear (should show 5s confirmation now)
- Monitor canvas autonomy (should auto-save/clear)
- Next reboot: verify awakening count accurate
- Continue Lumen observations

## Future Enhancements

- **Hardware Broker Pattern** (see `docs/architecture/HARDWARE_BROKER_PATTERN.md`)
  - ✅ **Phase 1 COMPLETE** (Gemini) - SharedMemoryClient created, stable_creature.py writes to `/dev/shm/anima_state.json`
  - ✅ **Phase 2 COMPLETE & VERIFIED** (Composer + Gemini) - server.py and workflow_orchestrator.py read from shared memory, safeguard updated, verified by Gemini
  - ⏳ **Phase 3 OPTIONAL** - Redis optimization if needed
  - **Current status**: ✅ **"Holy Grail" architecture achieved** - Both scripts can run simultaneously safely! MCP server reads from shared memory (broker), no I2C conflicts. Ready for deployment.
