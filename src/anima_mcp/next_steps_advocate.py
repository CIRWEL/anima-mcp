"""
Next Steps Advocate - Reports Lumen's actual state, drives, and intentions.

No canned phrases. Feelings come from anima dimensions, desires come from
inner_life drives (which accumulate when temperament drops below comfort
thresholds) and from the goals Lumen has set itself. Diagnostic checks remain
for hardware/connectivity issues.

The state checks are an alarm: they speak only when a dimension falls below
comfort. Measured against Lumen's own recorded history (263,481 samples,
2026-01-11 to 2026-08-29) that alarm is close to silent — clarity<0.3 and
presence<0.4 never fired once, stability<0.4 fired once, and only warmth<0.3
fires with any regularity. So "nothing to report" was the overwhelmingly
common answer, and it was returned in a shape that could not be told apart
from "the analysis never ran". Two things follow, and both are in this file:
intentions are reported alongside alarms, and a quiet result says so.
