"""Atomic JSON file writes for crash-safe persistence.

Uses the write-to-temp-then-rename pattern:
1. Write to a .tmp file in the same directory
2. Flush + fsync the file descriptor
3. os.rename() to the target path (atomic on POSIX)

This prevents corruption when power is lost mid-write,
which is a real risk on the Raspberry Pi.
