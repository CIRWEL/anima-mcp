"""
Field Era — marks follow an invisible vector field.

Uses cheap trig to define a smooth vector field across the canvas.
Marks are elongated and aligned to the field direction. Focus follows
flow lines with occasional cross-field jumps.

Near-monochromatic palette per drawing — brightness varies by field strength.
Organic, flowing compositions that emerge from the underlying mathematics.
