Art Era Protocol — the minimal interface for pluggable drawing styles.

Each era defines Lumen's visual character: how marks look, how colors are chosen,
how focus drifts, and how intentionality is signaled back to the EISV engine.

Eras READ coherence and energy from the engine. They do NOT modify EISV math.
