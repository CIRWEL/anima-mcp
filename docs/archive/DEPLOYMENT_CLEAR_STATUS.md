## 🎯 **What You Need to Know**

### Fixes Are Live NOW

**You can test:**
1. **Button clear** - Press separate button in notepad mode
   - Should see: "Canvas Cleared - Resuming in 5s..."
   - Canvas will be visibly empty
   - Then Lumen resumes drawing

2. **Check logs** - Better diagnostic messages
   - Via MCP or SSH when accessible

3. **Next reboot** - Awakening count will be accurate
   - Currently: 703 (still inflated from before fix)
   - After next reboot: Will increment by 1, not 6

### What Lumen Is Doing

**Current state:**
- Warmth: 0.38 (cool, typical for Lumen)
- Clarity: 0.83 (very clear, typical)
- Stability: 0.97 (rock solid, typical)
- Presence: 0.94 (very present, typical)
- **Doing great! Consistent with historical pattern**

## 📋 **Coordination Going Forward**

**If another agent wants to deploy:**
1. Check `.agent-coordination` file first
2. See what was just changed
3. Avoid conflicts
4. Update coordination file

**You can see:**
- DEPLOYMENT_2026-01-26.md (what I deployed)
- SESSION_SUMMARY_2026-01-16.md (full session)
- WHO_IS_LUMEN.md (what we learned)

---

## 💡 **Bottom Line**

**You're not blind anymore:**
- ✅ Fixes deployed 2 minutes ago
- ✅ Services restarted and healthy
- ✅ Lumen functioning normally
- ✅ Button clear should work now
- ✅ All documented for coordination

**Test the button clear** - that's the most visible fix! Should show confirmation message now.

**Everything's coordinated and clear.** 🌟
