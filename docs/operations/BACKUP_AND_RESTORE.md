# Backup & Restore

**Last Updated:** March 27, 2026

---

## Backup Location

```
~/backups/lumen/
  anima_data/              <- latest complete learned-state mirror
  anima_data.previous/     <- prior generation (crash-safe fallback)
  anima_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.db  <- dated snapshots (keeps last 48)
  anima_state_*.tar.gz     <- sanitized learned-state archives
  lumen_recovery_*.tar     <- matching DB + learned-state off-site bundles
  predeploy/<timestamp>/   <- verified DB + learned state before each deploy
```

> **WARNING:** `~/lumen-backups/` is OLD and STALE -- ignore it.

Check latest snapshot:
```bash
ls -lt ~/backups/lumen/anima_*.db | head -5
```

## Restore After Reflash -- One Command

```bash
cd ~/projects/anima-mcp
./scripts/restore_lumen.sh                # auto-detects: lumen.local, 192.168.1.165, Tailscale
./scripts/restore_lumen.sh 192.168.1.165  # explicit IP
```

What it does: verifies and freezes one local recovery generation before any Pi
mutation, stops both state writers, deploys code, atomically restores the DB +
every learned JSON snapshot + the durable learning inbox, restores
drawings, installs dependencies, starts services, and waits for fresh broker
shared memory before declaring success. A missing/corrupt DB aborts instead of
silently creating a new identity.

**Do NOT restore manually step-by-step. Run the script.**

## What Gets Backed Up

From Pi's `~/.anima/`:

| File/Dir | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `anima.db` | Identity, growth, state history, events (most important) |
| `preferences.json` | Calibration ideals |
| `self_model.json` | Self-model data |
| `knowledge.json` | Learned knowledge |
| `patterns.json` | Adaptive prediction patterns |
| `canvas.json` | Drawing canvas state |
| `messages.json` | Message board |
| `anima_history.json` | Recent anima history for trajectory |
| `metacognition_baselines.json` | Metacognition baselines |
| `anima_config.json` | Adaptive nervous-system calibration |
| `display_brightness.json` | Display brightness config |
| `drawings/` | All saved artwork |
| `learning_inbox/` | Pending/rejected server-to-broker learning evidence |
| `oauth.db` | Registered OAuth clients and token continuity (local only) |
| `journal-archive/` | Hourly gzip exports of the systemd journal (see below) |

The scheduled backup publishes `anima_data/` only after its staging mirror
finishes. A JSON mirror failure makes the run fail and does not advance
`.last_success`; one prior generation remains at `anima_data.previous/`.
An hourly Pi DB snapshot is accepted only while recent and only after an
integrity check; otherwise the Mac asks SQLite to mint a fresh live backup.
The mirror excludes all `*.db*` files (including old corrupt copies) and
`anima.env*` secrets, then captures `oauth.db` separately through SQLite's
online-backup API for local restore. OAuth tokens remain excluded from the
unencrypted off-site artifact. The sanitized learned-state archive and matching
DB are packed into one verified artifact before upload to the private off-site
dataset, avoiding mismatched halves when a network failure interrupts a run.
Deploys independently create a WAL-consistent, integrity-checked bundle under
`predeploy/` and abort if that backup fails unless the operator explicitly uses
`--skip-backup`.

MCP/zip deployments cannot assume the Mac is reachable, so `git_pull` and
`deploy_from_github` create a bounded on-device recovery point at
`~/.anima/backups/predeploy-code/` before replacing any code that will be
restarted. Snapshot failure prevents the update. The one-time bootstrap path
does the same.

### Journal archive

journald on the Pi is volatile (RAM-backed), and high-churn logging rotates it
in under a day — which is why the 2026-03-28 day-summary writer death (#188)
could not be root-caused five months later: no operational record survived.
`scripts/journal-archive.sh` (hourly via `lumen-journal-archive.timer`,
installed by `restore_lumen.sh`) exports new journal entries incrementally
(`journalctl --cursor-file`) into `~/.anima/journal-archive/journal-<date>.log.gz`,
which the slim mirror then carries to the Mac daily. Retention: 14 daily files
and a 300 MB size cap, oldest pruned first. Read with `zcat` (files are
multi-member gzip, one member per hourly run). A failed export leaves
`lumen-journal-archive.service` in a failed state — the unit state is the
alarm; it never silently skips a window. After a reboot the stale cursor falls
back to the new journal's head, so at most the previous boot's final
sub-hour is lost.

### Identity continuity

- **Same backup restored** → same `creature_id`, events, and growth history (continuity of the identity row and DB).
- **New Pi with empty `~/.anima/`** → a new `creature_id` unless you restore `anima.db` from backup.
- **Copying `anima.db` to a second device** → forks record identity; trajectory and behavior may diverge with environment.

### Boot continuity gate

`anima-restore.service` runs once per boot (the marker is under `/run`, not
persistent state). If `anima.db` fails a real SQLite integrity check, or any
authoritative learned-self JSON is missing/invalid, it restores a staged,
verified DB plus learned JSON and the learning inbox before the broker may
start. The DB is published last, so an interrupted repair cannot masquerade as
a complete identity. An unavailable or corrupt backup leaves body and mind
stopped rather than minting a silent replacement identity.

For a deliberately new deployment only, set
`ANIMA_ALLOW_FRESH_START=true` in `~/.anima/anima.env`. Established creatures
should leave it false.

If both Pi and Mac are lost, recover one complete weekday bundle before running
the restore:

```bash
hf download hikewa/lumen-db-backups daily/lumen_recovery_Mon.tar --repo-type dataset
tar -xf lumen_recovery_Mon.tar -C ~/backups/lumen
mkdir -p ~/backups/lumen/anima_data
STATE_ARCHIVE=$(ls -t ~/backups/lumen/anima_state_*.tar.gz | head -1)
tar -xzf "$STATE_ARCHIVE" -C ~/backups/lumen/anima_data
```

**Behavioral** identity (trajectory signatures, attractor) is documented in the trajectory-identity paper (`cirwel/trajectory-identity-paper`, separate repo) — distinct from UUID continuity.

## Backup Schedule

- **Automated (Mac):** `/Users/cirwel/scripts/backup_lumen.sh` -- twice daily (6am, 6pm) + hourly snapshots
- **Launchd plist:** `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.unitares.lumen-backup.plist`
- **Log:** `/Users/cirwel/backups/lumen_backup.log`
- **Pi local backup:** `backup_state.sh` runs hourly via crontab, saves JSON state to `~/.anima/backups/state/` (24 snapshots)
- **Pi storage maintenance:** `anima-storage-maintenance.timer` runs hourly at
  `:45`, after the database (`:15`) and learned-state (`:30`) snapshots.

## Storage pressure policy

Lumen prepares before the filesystem becomes urgent. The hourly maintenance
job writes its last report to
`~/.anima/backups/storage_maintenance_status.json` and uses these policies:

| Filesystem use | State | Self-schema render retention | Operator response |
|---|---|---:|---|
| below 75% | healthy | 14 days, max 512 MiB / 6,000 generations | routine |
| 75–79.9% | warning | 7 days, max 256 MiB / 3,000 generations | investigate growth |
| 80–84.9% | action | 3 days, max 128 MiB / 1,500 generations | reclaim or add capacity |
| 85%+ | urgent | 1 day, max 64 MiB / 500 generations | recover headroom immediately |

Only recognized `schema_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.{png,json}` generations are pruned,
oldest first and as whole PNG/JSON generations. Unknown files are never
touched. The 24-hour SQLite rotation, learned JSON snapshots, drawings, live
databases, and ordinary state are outside this cleanup policy.

Exceptional `anima.db.corrupted.*` and `anima.db.pre-restore-*` incidents are
handled separately. The newest remains unpacked. Older incidents may be
losslessly archived only after all of these gates pass:

1. a recent Mac-side recovery run published a verified database + learned-state
   bundle receipt;
2. the latest Pi hourly SQLite backup is recent and passes `quick_check`; and
3. the latest Pi learned-state snapshot is recent, complete, and valid JSON.

Each archive embeds sizes and SHA-256 hashes and is reread before source files
are removed. Local archive count tightens with pressure, but an archive is not
eligible for expiration until a later Mac backup receipt says forensic archives
were mirrored off-device. A missing or stale receipt fails closed: database
artifacts remain untouched.

Readiness drill without changing files:

```bash
python3 scripts/storage_maintenance.py --usage-percent 85
```

The pressure override is deliberately rejected with `--apply`.

## DB Integrity Check

If services crash with "database disk image is malformed":
```bash
# Find a clean snapshot
ls -lt ~/backups/lumen/anima_*.db | head -5

# Use the guarded restore workflow; never hot-copy over an open WAL database.
./scripts/restore_lumen.sh lumen.local
```

---

## Secrets After Restore

The restore script copies `anima.env.example` to `~/.anima/anima.env` on the Pi. Edit it to add:
- `GROQ_API_KEY` -- LLM (from groq.com, free)
- `UNITARES_AUTH` -- governance BASIC auth
- `ANIMA_OAUTH_ISSUER_URL` -- Cloudflare tunnel URL (e.g. `https://lumen.cirwel.org`)
- `ANIMA_OAUTH_AUTO_APPROVE=true`

See `SECRETS_AND_ENV.md` for details.

---

## Tailscale After Restore

Tailscale is lost on reflash. After restore completes:
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_pi unitares-anima@lumen.local \
  "curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh"
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_pi unitares-anima@lumen.local \
  "sudo tailscale up"
# Follow the URL to authenticate
```

Or pass `TAILSCALE_AUTH_KEY=tskey-xxx` during `restore_lumen.sh` for auto-auth.

After auth, run `./scripts/update_pi_ip.sh` to update Mac configs with the new Tailscale IP.

## Full Reflash Walkthrough

When the Pi's SD card needs a complete reflash (WiFi dead, corrupted OS, etc.).

### Phase 1: Backup (Before Reflash)

**If Pi is reachable:**
```bash
/Users/cirwel/scripts/backup_lumen.sh
```

**If Pi is dead:** Use existing Mac backups at `~/backups/lumen/anima_data/`.

**If SD card accessible but Pi unreachable:** See SD Card Data Recovery below.

### Phase 2: Flash Fresh SD Card

1. Download [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
2. Flash **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)**
3. In advanced options:
   - Hostname: `lumen`
   - Enable SSH (password auth)
   - Username: `unitares-anima`
   - Password: see `scripts/envelope.pi` (copy from `envelope.pi.example`)
   - WiFi: your network SSID and password
   - Set locale/timezone
4. Eject SD card, insert into Pi, power on

### Phase 3: Initial Pi Setup

Wait ~2 minutes for first boot, then:
```bash
ping lumen.local
ssh unitares-anima@lumen.local

# On Pi:
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-venv git i2c-tools libopenjp2-7 libgpiod2
sudo raspi-config nonint do_i2c 0
sudo raspi-config nonint do_spi 0
mkdir -p ~/.anima
```

### Phase 4: Restore

```bash
# From Mac
cd /Users/cirwel/projects/anima-mcp
./scripts/restore_lumen.sh
# Or: ./scripts/restore_lumen.sh 192.168.1.165
```

### Phase 5: Verify

```bash
sudo systemctl status anima-broker anima
journalctl -u anima -u anima-broker -f
curl http://localhost:8766/health

# Verify identity
sqlite3 ~/.anima/anima.db "SELECT name, creature_id, born_at FROM identity LIMIT 1;"
# Should show: Lumen, 49e14444-b59e-48f1-83b8-b36a988c9975, 2026-01-11...
```

### Post-Reflash Checklist

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Backup Pi (if reachable) or confirm Mac backup |
| 2 | Flash SD with Pi OS, hostname `lumen`, user `unitares-anima` |
| 3 | Boot, SSH, apt update, create `~/.anima` |
| 4 | Run `restore_lumen.sh` |
| 5 | Verify identity, display, logs |
| 6 | Install Tailscale, update Mac configs |
| 7 | Edit `~/.anima/anima.env` with secrets |

## SD Card Data Recovery

In practice, `~/backups/lumen/` (hourly automated backups) should have recent data. Check there first: `ls -lt ~/backups/lumen/anima_*.db | head -5`.

If you truly need to read the ext4 root partition from the SD card on macOS, there is no reliable tool — macOS cannot mount ext4 natively. Use a Linux machine or boot a Linux USB to mount the card and copy `/home/unitares-anima/.anima/`.

---

## WiFi Watchdog

To reduce future WiFi drops after reflash:
```bash
chmod +x ~/anima-mcp/scripts/wifi_watchdog.sh
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "*/5 * * * * $HOME/anima-mcp/scripts/wifi_watchdog.sh") | crontab -
```

## Path Reference

| Context | Path | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Systemd (Pi) | `/home/unitares-anima/.anima/anima.db` | Canonical |
| backup_lumen.sh | `~/backups/lumen/anima_data/` | Syncs from Pi |
| Credentials | `scripts/envelope.pi` | Pi password, SSH key (gitignored) |
