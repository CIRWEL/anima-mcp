Tests for growth system — goal lifecycle, drawing observation, migration sentinel,
curiosity, dimension preferences, and autobiography.

Covers:
  - Goal formation, progress tracking, achievement, abandonment
  - Drawing observation counters, milestones, preference learning
  - Migration sentinel write and bogus-category resilience
  - Curiosity add/dedup/explore lifecycle
  - Autobiography generation with and without data
  - Dimension preference mapping from categorical preferences
