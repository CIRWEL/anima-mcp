"""
Tests for earned vs. bail-out completion path tagging.

Validates that `DrawingState.completion_reason()` returns a correct tag for
each path, that `CanvasState` persists `last_completion_reason`, and that
growth memory writes ("pleased with", milestones) are gated so bail-out
completions do not produce autobiographical memories that imply earned
aesthetic resolution.
